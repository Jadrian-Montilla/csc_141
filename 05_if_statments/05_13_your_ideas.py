'''There's a lot of games i would want to make, a lot of different genres.
I want to be able to create a fun and interactive turn-based rpg,
and create a story people can ponder and enjoy for years after the experience.
I'd also want to learn how to optimize games and softwares
so that everyone can join in and experience it.

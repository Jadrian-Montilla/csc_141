# If I had infinite programming skills, there would only be 2 projects i'd like to create.
# I'd want to create an RPG with an amazing story, akin to a popular indie game that takes place in a cave.
# Programming may not be its strong suit but not needing to find a programmer and having the ability to fix any bugs anyone comes across would feel great.
# I'd also like to create a platformer, a pretty complex platformer. It's an idea I've been working around with for a couple of years now and to finally fulfill that would be a dream.
# Lastly with my skills I'd want to assist my programming friends and free them of any stress they might have. Programming is a difficult task since it is what creates the games, projects, and media after all.
